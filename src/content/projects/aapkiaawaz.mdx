## Aapki Awaz: Bridging Communication Gaps
Aapki Awaz is a groundbreaking project that aims to enhance communication with deaf individuals, leveraging cutting

### Data Collection Model

The data collection model leverages OpenCV and CVZone to capture and preprocess hand gesture images for training a classifier.

### Libraries Used: ###
  - cv2: Video capture and image processing.
  - cvzone.HandTrackingModule: Hand detection.
  - cvzone.ClassificationModule: Classification.
  - numpy: Numerical operations.
  - math: Calculations.
  - pyttsx3: Text-to-speech conversion.

### Web Integration

The system is integrated into a website using Bootstrap for styling and Flask for the backend API.

#### Frontend:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the UI.
- Bootstrap for responsive design.

#### Backend:

- Flask to serve the model and handle API requests.
- The API captures video frames, processes them using the gesture recognition model, and returns the recognized alphabet to the frontend.
