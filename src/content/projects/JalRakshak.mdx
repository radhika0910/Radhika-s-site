summary: "This Python application allows users to export data from a Microsoft Access database into an Excel file. The user can specify a start and end date range to select the data they want to export. The data is then retrieved from the Access database using the Pyodbc library and converted into a pandas DataFrame. Finally, the selected data is exported to an Excel file using the Pandas library."

# Jalrakshak Dashboard: Real-time Water Management

## Overview
Jalrakshak Dashboard addresses the challenge of tracking and monitoring water leakages and pilferage through a sophisticated system that integrates GIS tracking, real-time data analytics, and machine learning models.

## Key Features
### 1. Real-time GIS Tracking
- **Node Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of nodes with GIS, providing up-to-date information on node location, pressure, and flow rate.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualization of node data on an interactive map using React-Leaflet and MarkerClusterGroup.

### 2. Leakage and Pilferage Detection
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes pressure and flow rate data to detect anomalies indicating leakages or pilferage.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive models trained to identify potential issues based on sensor data.

### 3. Optimal Sensor Placement
- **EPANET Integration**: Uses EPANetSimulation to determine the least number of sensors needed for effective monitoring.
- **Graph Creation**: Generates optimal sensor placement strategies and visualizes them on the dashboard.

### 4. Data Visualization
- **Graphs and Charts**: Power BI integration for visual representation of data, trends, and patterns.
- **API Integration**: Backend APIs hosted on Flask to fetch and display data on the dashboard.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Developed using Next.js with React, leveraging Leaflet for GIS tracking and interactive mapping.
- **Backend**: Connected with Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **APIs**: Hosted on Flask, enabling seamless data communication between frontend and backend.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow and scikit-learn for training and deploying predictive models.
- **Data Handling**: Utilized pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Schedulers**: Implemented APScheduler for scheduled tasks and background processing.

## Libraries and Tools
- **React**: For building the frontend user interface.
- **Leaflet**: For interactive maps and GIS tracking.
- **Firebase**: As the backend for real-time database management.
- **Flask**: For hosting APIs and machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow**: For developing and deploying machine learning models.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and analytics.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with more advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Expansion to include more comprehensive water management features.
- Enhanced user interface with more detailed analytics and reporting capabilities.
